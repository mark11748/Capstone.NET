## **Tower Defense Game**
#### _Mark Woodward_

## Description
A browser-based tower defense game. Enemies will move along a path to your main structure. You must click available points on the map to place towers which will attempt to destroy enemies in range. Towers cost resources which are gained from destroying enemies. If an enemy reaches your main structure they will damage it. If the main structure takes to much damage the game is over. This game has only one map and enemy waves are unlimited but you will be able to choose when they begin by a button at the top left.
